<li><span class="topic">The same thing</span>
<ul>
<li class="sent">I replied as follows: The same thing clearly cannot act or be acted upon in the same part or in
relation to the same thing at the same time, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this
contradiction occurs in things apparently the same, we know that they are really not the same,
but different.

relation to the same thing at the same time, in contrary ways; and therefore whenever this

</li>
<li class="sent">But were we not saying that such a contradiction is the same faculty cannot have contrary
opinions at the same time about the same thing?
Very true.
</li>
<li class="sent">For example, I said, can the same thing be at rest and in motion at the same time in the same
part?
Impossible.
</li>
<li class="sent">Then none of these objections will confuse us, or incline us to believe that the same thing at the
same time, in the same part or in relation to the same thing, can act or be acted upon in
contrary ways.

</li>
<li class="sent">And if you suppose something which pulls a thirsty soul away from drink, that must be different
from the thirsty principle which draws him like a beast to drink; for, as we were saying, the same
thing cannot at the same time with the same part of itself act in contrary ways about the same.

<li><span class="topic">The same time</span>

</li>
<li class="sent">You will very likely say with neither, and that your chief aim in carrying on the
argument is your own improvement; at the same time you do not grudge to others any benefit
which they may receive.
</li>
<li class="sent">Then the same person will hardly be able to play a serious part in life, and at the same time to
be an imitator and imitate many other parts as well; for even when two species of imitation are
nearly allied, the same persons cannot succeed in both, as, for example, the writers of tragedy
and comedy--did you not just now call them imitations?
</li>
<li class="sent">At the same time I ought here to repeat what I have said elsewhere, that if any of our guardians
shall try to be happy in such a manner that he will cease to be a guardian, and is not content
with this safe and harmonious life, which, in our judgment, is of all lives the best, but infatuated
by some youthful conceit of happiness which gets up into his head shall seek to appropriate the
whole State to himself, then he will have to learn how wisely Hesiod spoke, when he said, `half
is more than the whole.</li>
<li class="sent">And suppose the objector to refine still further, and to draw the nice distinction that not only
parts of tops, but whole tops, when they spin round with their pegs fixed on the spot, are at rest
and in motion at the same time (and he may say the same of anything which revolves in the
same spot), his objection would not be admitted by us, because in such cases things are not at
rest and in motion in the same parts of themselves; we should rather say that they have both an
axis and a circumference, and that the axis stands still, for there is no deviation from the
perpendicular; and that the circumference goes round.</li>
