<li><span class="topic">The long sword</span>
<ul>
<li class="sent">To hold the long sword in both hands is not the true
Way, for if you carry a bow or spear or other arms in your left hand you
have only one hand free for the long sword.</li>
<li class="sent">If his body is immoveable, you
can cut first with the long sword, but generally you hit first with the
body and then cut with the long sword.</li>
<li class="sent">To master the virtue of the long sword is to govern the world
and oneself, thus the long sword is the basis of strategy.</li>
<li class="sent">To Apply Stickiness
When the enemy attacks and you also attack with the long sword, you
should go in with a sticky feeling and fix your long sword against the
enemy's as you receive his cut.</li>
<li class="sent">You must
become well acquainted with my "in harmony with the long sword"
Way, learn large-scale timing, understand the enemy's long sword, and
become used to the five approaches from the outset.</li>
<li class="sent">To learn how to win with the long sword in strategy, first learn the
five approaches and the five attitudes, and absorb the Way of the long
sword naturally in your body.</li>
<li class="sent">Holding the Long Sword
14
Grip the long sword with a rather floating feeling in your thumb and
forefinger, with the middle finger neither tight nor slack, and with the
last two fingers tight.</li>
<li class="sent">Other Schools with many Methods of using the Long Sword
Placing a great deal of importance on the attitudes of the long sword is
a mistaken way of thinking.</li>
<li class="sent">The Way of the Long Sword
Knowing the Way of the long sword means we can wield with two fin-
gers the sword we usually carry.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><span class="topic">The world's strategists</span>
<ul>
<li class="sent">Some of the world's strategists are concerned only with sword-fencing,
and limit their training to flourishing the long sword and carriage of the
body.</li>
